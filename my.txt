Each week Blue Jays Confidential will ask a panel of Sportsnet Blue Jays Insiders and personalities to weigh in on issues big and small with the team, and around Major League Baseball.

1. Now that the Blue Jays have extended Randal Grichuk, who else on the 25-man roster could you see them considering extending before the season is over, especially with players across MLB appearing less inclined to test free agency?
Jeff Blair (@SNJeffBlair):
Ken Giles… and I think they’ll extend one of Aaron Sanchez or Marcus Stroman. I know there are issues with both of them in terms of trust/happiness with the front office and, in Sanchez’s case, Scott Boras representing him. But I wonder if that trust is rebuilt this year… might Boras strike a deal with the Jays the way he did with a young Stephen Strasburg and the Nationals?

Arden Zwelling (@ArdenZwelling):
Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez are the two obvious candidates, but the Blue Jays haven’t shown any inclination to even begin those discussions, and it’s difficult to imagine either of those players and the club lining up on value considering the seasons those two are coming off of. Inking Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to something similar to the Eloy Jimenez deal would make a lot of sense. But Guerrero Jr.’s already a millionaire thanks to the $3.9-million bonus the Blue Jays gave him at 16 — not to mention his father earned more than $100-million over his career — so he’s uniquely positioned to bet on himself and go year-to-year through arbitration.

Shi Davidi (@ShiDavidi):
Given the state of their pitching, they should try to extend Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez because otherwise they’re going to spend the next few years trying to recreate them, but I doubt that happens. The sweet spot where player and team are sharing risk in the deal is really hard to find for both sides here, with the Blue Jays not likely to be willing to bet enough on either pitcher to buy them out of the chance to max out on the open market. But they got there with another four-plus years of service in Grichuk, so I suppose it’s possible.

Ben Nicholson-Smith (@bnicholsonsmith):
On the roster? At some point it’ll probably be worth having that conversation with Danny Jansen. But most intriguing of all are two guys who haven’t yet joined the roster: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. If the Blue Jays can sign either one to an Eloy Jimenez-style deal that extends club control for a (relatively) modest guarantee, that’d be worth doing.

Mike Wilner (@Wilnerness590): 
I think the obvious answers are Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez, should they show they’re healthy and capable of pitching the way they did when they were at their best in the past.

While most people believed (and likely still do) that the departure of at least the two righties was all but a fait accompli for this season (and it still may be), the Blue Jays don’t have a tonne of starting pitching knocking on the door of the big leagues, and keeping two elite (when healthy) starters would serve them well.

Beyond those two, other potential extensions include Ken Giles who, like Grichuk would have, hits free agency after next season. The other side of that coin is that there could be a terrific return in a trade for Giles this July. Danny Jansen and Brandon Drury, should he hit the way the Jays believe he will, are also candidates, but their free agency is well down the road. It would really be something if they threw a Ronald Acuna deal at Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. or an Eloy Jimenez contract at Bo Bichette.

2. What’s your favourite Kevin Pillar story/moment/play? On-field or off
Jeff Blair (@SNJeffBlair):
Being sent down to Triple-A after throwing a dugout tantrum in 2014 when John Gibbons pinch-hit for him. That he was able to make it back says a lot about him… and Gibbons.

Arden Zwelling (@ArdenZwelling):
Plenty to choose from, but I’ll go with the one I led this 2016 feature with, in which Pillar puts a pitch thrown to the opposite batter’s box in play and slides head-first into first base to win an Appalachian League batting title (ahead of Brandon Drury of all people). There’s another one from that Bluefield season when Pillar went flying into the stands after a foul ball to try to get an out for Aaron Sanchez. It was a nasty spill, but when Sanchez ran over to check on him, the first thing Pillar did was apologize for not catching the ball. That’s Pillar in a nutshell. I’ll genuinely miss covering him. He was always interesting to write about and gave very thoughtful answers to whatever you asked him. I hope fans give him the ovation he deserves when he’s back with the Giants later this month.

Shi Davidi (@ShiDavidi):
For all the crap talked about him on social media, he really had an impactful run with the Blue Jays. The play that probably sticks out the most for me is the catch at Wrigley Field, when he literally ran into a brick wall to make a catch. It at least bordered on, if not was completely reckless, but he managed to maintain control, avoid injury and again demonstrate how determined he is to chase down every ball.



Ben Nicholson-Smith (@bnicholsonsmith):
Lots to choose from here, but a play from the opening series of 2018 stuck with me. In the third game of the season, Pillar reached against reliever Dellin Betances then proceeded to steal second, third and home to the surprise of the Yankees. To me that sequence showed off Pillar’s combination of boldness and baseball instincts.

Mike Wilner (@Wilnerness590): 
I don’t think I can pick one. Going over the wall at Rogers Centre twice to pull back home runs – once in left field, once in centre. That’s a feat that has only been accomplished one other time (by Rajai Davis, who had time to take a running leap at the wall). Slamming into the brick wall at Wrigley Field in August of 2017 to make a catch with zero regard for his physical health. Hitting a neck-high fastball out of the park in Texas off Yu Darvish in Game 2 of the 2016 ALDS. The two homers off Max Scherzer in the “nap game.”

And last year at Fenway Park, Pillar suffered a sprain of his right sternoclavicular joint that could have been life-threatening. We were told he would be in a sling for a week, would be re-evaluated after three weeks and could play again in four to six weeks. He was out of the line-up just 18 days and had two hits his second game back.

This from a man whose chin was so strong that it once broke Troy Tulowitzki’s shoulder blade.

3. Many fans are unsure of Anthony Alford’s upside given his turbulent career to date. How much of his previous prospect lustre did he restore — in your eyes and those of the organization’s — with his strong spring?
Jeff Blair (@SNJeffBlair):
The Jays are a fan of the player and person. Ross Atkins has said he’d love to have Alford force his hand and get a roster spot. He’s helped by a lack of outfield depth in the organization.

Arden Zwelling (@ArdenZwelling):
I’m on record saying the Blue Jays should be giving Anthony Alford regular major-league reps right now. To me, there’s a dissonance in trading Kevin Pillar with the stated intention of opening up playing time for your younger players, only to give that opportunity to an older player who’s been cast away by two organizations within the last week. I’m sure some Blue Jays staff feel Alford’s plate approach could use refinement before he’s tested with big-league pitching. But was Pillar’s plate approach refined? Is Teoscar Hernandez’s or Randal Grichuk’s? I’d give Alford a chance to sink or swim in the majors right now. Because if he can channel his immense tools and put it all together, the upside could be huge.

Shi Davidi (@ShiDavidi):
I was talking to one player about him recently and his take was that Alford is still super talented, if a little raw. He’s going to be good. The tools are off the charts, so many describe him as a terrific person and teammate, and he’s just in the grind so many players, especially ones who have missed time like he has, trying to break through often endure.

Ben Nicholson-Smith (@bnicholsonsmith):
Some of it. The four home runs he hit were a great sign for the Blue Jays, because it’s a lot easier to see a path to success if he pairs legitimate power with his athleticism. At the same time, it’s spring training. For it to really count, he has to do this at the highest level. Now, he’s getting that chance.

Mike Wilner (@Wilnerness590): 
I am a huge fan of Anthony Alford’s, and I hope that he realizes the incredible potential he has – though I imagine with the arrival of Socrates Brito, he’s going to be trying to put it together in Buffalo, which isn’t a bad thing at this point. The thing about his strong spring, though (.978 OPS, second on the team with four home runs), is that it was really only a phenomenal four days. From March 6 to 9, Alford had an incredible run, going 6-for-11 with four homers, a double and a pair of walks. Before that run, he had been 1-for-8. And after that run? He went 1-for-14. That streak, though, showed just how great he can be when he’s locked in, and definitely reminded people just how much ability he has.

4. Has Lourdes Gurriel’s early season defence at second base been as bad we think it’s been, or is the jury still out on whether he can improve enough to play the position long-term? If he can’t, what’s next for him?
Jeff Blair (@SNJeffBlair):
In any other season I’d throw in the towel on him as a second baseman. I don’t know what’s next – left field?

Arden Zwelling (@ArdenZwelling):
What must be maddening for the Blue Jays when it comes to Lourdes Gurriel Jr. is that he’s extremely athletic and capable of making spectacular, highlight reel plays like this. But it’s the routine plays that seem to challenge him. Hit Gurriel an ordinary two-hopper and he’s liable to boot it. Everyday turns at second can produce wild throws. I don’t know how to solve that inconsistency. But if this season’s about anything, it’s giving young players a chance to succeed or fail at the major-league level. So, on he goes.
